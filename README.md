# Evermann
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2021

## Theme
We interpreted the theme pick your poison as making choices. So in Evermann, players must choose the correct doors to prevent them from going insane. 

## Game Play
The objective is to escape Evermann by selecting the correct doors. 
Choose a door, depending on which door you choose you may be safe, find an item, or run into the creature.

## Impediments
Creating out own model proved to be difficult as blender sculpting was very unhelpful and misleading. 
Finding item models as well. Also, we had issues with the Github Branches

## Implementation
All sounds were created by Andy Myers in Audacity
Scenes and code were implemented by Xander Wilson and Gabe Cooney
